Beluga whale optimization (BWO) algorithm is a swarm-based metaheuristic algorithm for solving optimization problems. BWO is inspired from the behaviors of beluga whales, consisting of three phases: exploration phase, exploitation phase, and whale fall phase. The illustrating examples of some benchmark functions are provided in this website.
